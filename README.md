# Google-Merchandise-Store-Analysis
Google Merchendise Store has experienced strong overall growth in the last quarter. Total revenue increased by 21.4% and though active users grew by 9.7% for the quarter but there is a downward trend in active user for the month of december. This might be due to holiday season but needs further analysis.

## Key Findings
### Revenue Growth
Total Revenue for the quarter increased to $911 K; growth of 21.4%.

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for the quarter increased by 10.6% to $4.04. But US is skewing the results as ARPU for other countries is much lower.

### User Acquisition
The active user and new new users has increased by 9.7% and 10.7% respectively. But total no. of active and new users are almost same, this indicates that there is new user acquisition but they are lacking user retention.
